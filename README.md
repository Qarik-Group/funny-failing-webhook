# Funny Failing Webhook for Kubernetes

This demonstration project shows a very simple Kubernetes webhook server, that is deployed publicly on Google Cloud Run, and sample configuration for your Kubernetes cluster.

Any requests to CREATE pods into a specific namespace will fail, with a random funny message.

This example webhook server assumes it has HTTPS provided for it by Cloud Run, and does not need to talk to your Kubernetes cluster, so its much simpler to write than common webooks that might want to interact with your Kubernetes cluster, or might need to manage their own TLS certificates for HTTPS.

Step 1: Install the webhook and create a safe namespace for testing:

```plain
kubectl apply -f webhook-config.yaml
```

Step 2: Create some resources into the safe namespace:

```plain
kubectl apply -f test-resources/
```

The output will show them all being rejected:

```plain
Error from server: error when creating "test-resources/daemonset.yaml": admission webhook "funny-failing-webhook.starkandwayne.com" denied the request: admission error: Yeah, no, not happening (allowed: false)
Error from server: error when creating "test-resources/deployment.yaml": admission webhook "funny-failing-webhook.starkandwayne.com" denied the request: admission error: Yeah, no, not happening (allowed: false)
Error from server: error when creating "test-resources/job.yaml": admission webhook "funny-failing-webhook.starkandwayne.com" denied the request: admission error: Yeah, no, not happening (allowed: false)
Error from server: error when creating "test-resources/pod.yaml": admission webhook "funny-failing-webhook.starkandwayne.com" denied the request: admission error: Yeah, no, not happening (allowed: false)
```

Step 3: Take down the webhook and delete the safe namespace:

```plain
kubectl delete -f webhook-config.yaml
```

Backend logs for the webhook show the receipt of AdmissionReview requests:

## Deploy to Cloud Run

Whilst this service is already running on Cloud Run, you might want to fork and deploy it yourself. You might want to see the logs.

Or, more likely, you are me. And I might want to do this in the future and need documentation. Luckily, I wrote myself a `Makefile` and the following documentation.

```plain
make
```

At the time of writing Google Cloud Run requires OCIs to be hosted on [Google Container Registry](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr) (GCR):

```plain
docker build -t gcr.io/drnic-257704/funny-failing-webhook .
docker push gcr.io/drnic-257704/funny-failing-webhook
```

To deploy as an unauthenticated service to Google Cloud Run:

```plain
gcloud run deploy funny-failing-webhook \
    --image gcr.io/drnic-257704/funny-failing-webhook \
    --platform managed \
    --region us-central1 \
    --allow-unauthenticated
```

To see the available Cloud Run service and its URL:

```plain
$ gcloud run services list --platform managed
   SERVICE                REGION       URL                                                    LAST DEPLOYED BY         LAST DEPLOYED AT
âœ”  funny-failing-webhook  us-central1  https://funny-failing-webhook-lg2hslfa4a-uc.a.run.app  drnic@starkandwayne.com  2020-01-05T22:25:49.899Z
...
```

We use https://funny-failing-webhook-lg2hslfa4a-uc.a.run.app in our webhook configuration.

Quick confirmation that our HTTP server can receive requests by hitting the `/` endpoint:

```plain
$ curl https://funny-failing-webhook-lg2hslfa4a-uc.a.run.app
Funny Failing Webhook always rejects pod CREATE requests
